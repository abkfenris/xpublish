# Ecosystem

Xpublish's ecosystem is made up of plugins and servers, and the folks who build and run them.

## Connect

We have two main venues for discussing Xpublish and it's ecosystem, Github Discussions and Slack.

### Github Discussions

For longer form discussions, we can be found in [Github Discussions](https://github.com/xarray-contrib/xpublish/discussions?discussions_q=).

### Slack

Xpublish has a channel (`#xpublish`) on [ESIP](https://www.esipfed.org/)'s (Earth Science Information Partners) Slack. (Insert Rich's justification here about ESIP being the biggest unbrella that he can find) [Join here](https://join.slack.com/t/esip-all/shared_invite/zt-1omjufm9z-iH8Gf7gmmsm2SiS5Xh6BlQ)
